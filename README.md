# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A classic two-player strategy game where opponents alternate turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The current player places their symbol (X or O), aiming to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching marks to win. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
